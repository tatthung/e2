## Notes for instruction
1. This is the modified version of the conventional rock-scissors-paper game.
2. As an additional challenge for myself to understand and learn the If and Else loop in depth, I have slightly increase the complexity of the game to make it more challenging by including If and Else 
loop within existing If and Else loop where in the case of a tie, both players get another chance where they can use their other hand to throw moves, and that will determine the winner for that round.
3. I have implemented an If and Else loop on index-view.php to publish (echo) the second-hand game results (after tie).
