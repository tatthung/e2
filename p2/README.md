# Notes for instruction 
1. This is the modified version of the conventional rock-scissors-paper game. 
2. Similar version of the game was built in Project 1 <http://e2p1.tatthung.me>, 
except we now require Player B (human player or you) to play the game against the Computer player. In the event of a tie in Round 1, a tiebreaker will happen between the two players. 
3. Both players are require to roll a dice. The player with the highest dice 
value will dominate the game.
