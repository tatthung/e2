## Notes for instruction 
1. This is the modified version of the conventional rock-scissors-paper game. 
2. As an additional challenge for myself to understand and learn the If and Else loop in depth, I have slightly increase the complexity 
of the game to make it more challenging by including If and Else loop within existing If and Else loop where in the case of a tie, both players get another 
chance where they can use their other hand to throw moves, and that will determine the winner for that round. 
3. I have implemented an If and Else loop on 
index-view.php to publish (echo) the second-hand game results (after tie).
