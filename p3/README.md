## Notes for instructor
Dear Susan 
1. Since this is just a project and is due for submission, I am going to stop and submit this rock-scissors-paper version.
2. I plan to expand my experience further by creating a tie breaker by introducing the second table (e.g. roundsTwo).
3. There is a tie break in the event of a tie, where both Player and Computer will randomly throw a dice to determine the final winner.
4. Can I try to work on such a game and ask you for guidance via email even after Week 14? 
Thank you.
